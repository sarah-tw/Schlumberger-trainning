<p>A long paragraph, A long paragraph, <a href="">inline element</a> Yet collaborative projects are not just about uniting necessary skills in order to get a job done. Over so many years we’ve witnessed groundbreaking collaborative campaigns that merged mutually exclusive skills because collaboration ignites creativity. And it’s in collaborative projects that much of the most astounding new creative work is to be found. “Collaboration is about allowing yourself to become contaminated with other people’s ideas and visions,” enthuses Bruno Sellés of Barcelona-based studio Vasava. “It’s about getting involved in work that forces you to think and act differently. It’s those unpredictable ideas that are the product of different takes on a common project. Sometimes it takes that clash of personalities, styles or attitudes to come out with something new. Collaborative projects are great playgrounds to get out of your comfort zone and try new things. It’s exciting.”
